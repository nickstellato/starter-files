# Theme

## Installation

```shell
mkdir theme && cd theme
git clone <repo address> .
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:

- Need to determine the proper npm scripts.
  - I need to build and dev
  - I want to be able to git clone, npm install, npm run dev and start developing with index.html from the dist folder being opened on a live server with reload.
